<h1>BEST MOVIE REVIEW </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<h3>
    <ul>
     <li>GOL MAAL 1979</li></h3>
            <IMG src="../assets/images/golmal.jpg"alt="mpvie"width="150" height="50"/>
    <p>This classic 70's flick is regarded by many as undoubtedly the greatest Bollywood comedy movie of all times. Utpal Dutt is mostly remembered for his role as a strict boss and a person who holds the qualities of the Raj era to his heart, and in the process creating a generation gap between himself and the entire world. The "Double Role" played by the next door boy Amol Palekar in order to cover his real colors in front of his boss and his girlfriend makes a riot of a script such that you will remember for a long time. R D Burman's "Golmaal" and Kishore Kumar's "Aane Waala Pal" are songs that render the heart with unsurpassed happiness and sorrow. All this has made this movie the greatest Hindi comedy flick of all times. A must watch movie!</p>

                     12th fail- THE BEST MOVIE OF 2023, period!

                This is a perfect example of how to take a movie with a strong and inspiring storyline based on true events. It portrays the crowd who has perseverance and never die attitude in pursuing civil services examination (UPSC) exams to eventually become IAS or IPS.
                
                Vidhu Vinod Chopra is a master story teller, and he sure knows to have the right blend of dialogue delivery with sensibility and delicacy.
                
                The "HUG" definition is shown as real and you can feel it.
                
                Screenplay is terrific with a touch of brilliance.
                
                Vikrant Massey's acting is a benchmark and he embodies it with full of life. His emotions, innocence, anger and happiness can be truly felt as he takes us through his tough journey to the pinnacle.
                
                Medha Shankar provides strong support for Vikrant. Their purest love, chemistry and just being there for one another when it's really needed is worth to withhold in your memory for a long time.
                
                Anant Joshi is the real friend one can wish for in their lifetime. Aisa dost sabko milna chahiye.
                
                Climax is multiple times clap worthy.
                
                10x respect for all those who pursued UPSC exams, tried multiple times and never lost hope. 100x respect for those who cleared the interview and serving for the government as the key administrators, and taking the country forward.
                
                This movie is a big inspiration for kids and future generation. It teaches them and us that life can be restarted multiple times and can bounce back stronger.
                
                12th FAIL is a BIG PASS with distinction (Rank 1, 100/100, GPA 4.0).

        <li>Chhichhore</li>
    </ol>

        Indian films have now come of age, they can give a message subtly without being preachy. Chhichhore begins with young Raghav suffering from a massive anxiety about whether he will crack the all India engineering entrance exam as he has invested 18 hours a day for the past many months preparing for it and wants to match the caliber of his parents.

        A failure to launch throws him into despair and the occasion brings together six middle aged people into a reunion with the objective of alleviating Raghav from his pain and encouraging him to bring hope back into his fragile life. LOSERS, as these six were known as in their student life, recount their carefree journey initially and the final effort to shrug off the underdog tag, drawing a significant parallel to Raghav's situation.

        Director Nitesh Tiwari handles the subject with sensitivity and balances the Losers journey through the undergraduate years well. There was ample temptation available to propel this segment of the film into being an over the top and loud essay, but Tiwari never gives in, thus rising above the ordinary. Sushant Singh Rajput delivers an underrated performance and Tahir Raj Bhasin adds gravitas. Naveen Polishetty, Tushar Pandey and Saharsh Kumar Shukla add to the little masala with their individual contribution, but the star of the Losers union must be Varun Sharma. He is absolutely a laugh riot with his expressions, one liners and an incredible energy, cracking up the theatre on numerous occasions. The weakest link is yet again Shraddha Kapoor, who needs to experiment with diversity of histrionic capabilities and expressions.

        Don't miss Chhichhore, it's a fantastic mood lifter and easy on the mind, often drawing you into the proceedings.
